This repository contains functions I have created for the analysis of Regional Ocean Modeling System data. Functions currently include methods for: 
    2023: 
    - calculation of simulated particle residence times in desired regions (RT.sh)
    - calculation of particle accumulation (number of particles) in desired regions (accumulation.sh)
    - connectivity metrics of simulated particles across desired regions (connectivity.sh)
