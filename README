This repository contains functions I have created for the analysis of Regional Ocean Modeling System data. All functions are written for R unless otherwise noted. Functions currently include methods for calculating: 
    2023: 
    - residence times of simulated particles in desired regions (RT.sh)
    - particle accumulation (number of particles) in desired regions (accumulation.sh)
    - connectivity metrics of simulated particles across desired regions (connectivity.sh)
